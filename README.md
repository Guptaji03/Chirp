<h1 align="center">Welcome to Chirp 👋</h1>

<br/>

<strong>Twitter</strong> is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages known as "tweets".Registered users can post, like, and retweet tweets.

In this project we have tried to clone the basic layout of <strong>Twitter</strong>. With our efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned so far in the masai school, we were able to clone the front end and some basic functionalities.

<br/>

- This is a react clone of the Twitter website
- and it was made in 1 week.
- The technologies used are used because they are beginner friendly and easy to use.
- The project had some time constraints and most of the indepth features are still in progress.
- If you are interested in contributing to this project feel free to do so.
